## Challenges

There were a lot of challenges for this project, but I dealing with the OVRInput controllers was challenging. Mainly because there are a lot of buttons, and I wasn't 100% what function was doing what. Had to go through a lot of trail and error. At one point, I was trying to go up and down through the menu but it was cycling through the items very quickly. I had to read through the documentations to us a GetUp command rather then a Get command. 

## Enjoyed

I really enjoyed the fact that I built an app for the Oculus platform. My main motivated for taking this VR Nano Degree was to learn how to develop on the Oculus. After this project, I feel like I can actually make some cool things on the platform.
